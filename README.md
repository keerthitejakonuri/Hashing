# Hashing


Objectives:

     Create a hash table.
     Use the hash table to improve a poor-performing program.


Description:

     Attached is a program file named DupLL.java.  Its purpose is to read
     a file of phone numbers and report duplicates.  Its main method opens a 
     file of 5003 phone numbers (ph.txt) in which one number has one duplicate
     and another number has two duplicates.

     It uses a LinkedList with a very poor-performing algorithm to find the duplicates.
     Due to the nested loops, the same duplicate will be reported more than once.

     We need to convert this program to use a hash table and improve the
     algorithm for finding the duplicates, reporting each duplicate once.  

     The hash table is my own creation, not copied from the textbook 
     or other sources.
